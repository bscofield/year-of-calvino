          <p>
            I can absolutely see some of the path between <a href="the-path-to-the-nest-of-spiders.html"><em>The Path to
                the Nest of Spiders</em></a> and Calvino's later works.
            The first ... half, maybe? ... of the stories are sketches, almost devoid of plot, but incredibly well-drawn
            images of the less well-off towns of Italy in the mid-20th century. Once we hit "Animal Woods," though,
            we're in full-on fairy tale mode, and "Theft in a Pastry Shop" continues it; the latter half of the stories
            drift in a more fantastic direction, though not as far as Calvino will go in the next Year of Calvino read
            (<a href="the-cloven-viscount.html"><em>The Cloven Viscount</em></a>).</p>

          <p>Theme-wise: Calvino has yet to write a female character as an actual character; women and girls are fully
            props most of the time -- see "Sleeping like Dogs" and "The Adventure of a Soldier" for instances where
            they're <em>actually</em> props.</p>

          <p>And, even in the early stories, there's both a focus on ants (prefiguring <em>The Argentine Ant</em>,
            maybe) and
            on <em>bounty</em>, on large masses of ... animals (ants), plants, etc. </p>

          <p>I <em>think</em> Calvino might be interested in exploring class, but it's pretty backgrounded in most of
            the stories -- overshadowed by people struggling in the aftermath of the war. There are a few stories
            focused on more powerful members of society, and they're entirely in the wrong ("The Master's Eye" and "A
            Judge Is Hanged", for instance.)
