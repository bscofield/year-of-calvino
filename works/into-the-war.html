          <p>Back to realism here, and to the war -- but not fully, not until almost the very end of "UNPA Nights," when
            the siren rings out and the fictional-Calvino remembers his duties and abandons Biancone to get back to
            them. </p>

          <p>These stories strike me as illustrating the ordinariness of life under fascism; life may look a little
            different (the field trip is to a conquered village across the border, or the reason two boys are left on
            their own is that they're supposed to be on watch for air raids), but the way the people act remains ...
            unexceptional. Teen boys rummage and pillage Menton, just as they might rampage through an abandoned mall in
            a suburb. </p>

          <p>Biancone is an interesting figure; in "The Avanguardisti in Menton" he's a little unknowable,
            unaccountable, inexplicable. He appears and disappears. The version in "UNPA Nights" feels like a reduced
            copy; the fantasy of him has vanished, and you're left with a boy trying to come off as more impressive than
            he is, more experienced than he is.</p>
